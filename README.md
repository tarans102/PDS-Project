# PDS-Project
Developed an ML-powered movie recommendation system that predicts user ratings based on past preferences. Implemented content-based filtering (TF-IDF & Count Vectorization) and collaborative filtering (SVD model) to enhance recommendation accuracy. Achieved high performance, validated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for evaluation.
Learnings: Implementing recommendation algorithms, preprocessing user data, and assessing model performance with evaluation metrics.
